Learn Go with AoC 2021

## Purpose
I am learning Go from a recommendation from my mentor at work. It is also good to add a tool to my toolbox and really, just to look at things from a different language perspective. This is the first step toward my goals of expanding my skillset even more this year. Thanks for checking out.

## Disclaimer
This is the code I'm writing while trying to learn Go. I highly doubt the way I do things are the recommended way. Please look at this repo with a grain of salt.
